You are given a string A of length N consisting of lowercase alphabets. Find the period of the string.
Period of the string is the minimum value of k (k >= 1), that satisfies A[i] = A[i % k] for all valid i.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^6

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = "abababab"
Input 2:
 A = "aaaa"

Example Output
Output 1:
 2
Output 2:
 1

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Period of the string will be 2: 
 Since, for all i, A[i] = A[i%2]. 
Explanation 2:
 Period of the string will be 1.
